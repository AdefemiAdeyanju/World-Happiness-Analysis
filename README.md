# World-Happiness-Analysis
An analysis on the standard of living in countries using python.

This project was undertaken to analysze the standards of living in each country; knowing the happiness score, perception of corruption etc. of the countries.

## Project Steps

### Step 1 - Data Collection

*I downloaded the dataset from kaggle.

*I imported the dataset from my local machine into the program.


### Step2 - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

*I derived basic information from the above collected data using the .info(), .describe, and .head() methods.

*I extracted the columns and copied them to a new variable.

*I renamed the columns and saved the dataset to a new variable.

*I inspected the dataset for null values.

*I inspected the logged gdp per capita on each region with the groupby() and sum() methods.

*I inspected the total number of countries logged gdp per capita of each region with the groupby() and count() methods.

*I inspected the mean of regional  corruption.


### Step3 - Data Visualization

*I visualized a plot between Happiness & GDP columns using scatterplot.

*I plotted a pie chart to visualise the GDP by Region.

*I visualized the correlation heatmap; using Pearson formula to distingish a relationship between the dataset.

*I plotted a bar chart displaying the Perception of Corruption in various Regions.

*I plotted the Top and Bottom 10 Happiest Countries life Expectancy using subplots of barchart.

*I plotted a scatter plot between freedom to make life choices and happiness score.

*I plotted a bar chart of countries with most perception of corruption.

*I plotted a scatterplot between happiness score and perceptions of corruption.


### Suggestions on future work/Improvement plans

*I would love to make future predictions using a machine learning algorithm to determine whether the happiness score of each country is appreciating or depreciating with time.
